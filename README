= Introduction

This gem is based off of Capistrano_s3 gem found at Github. This gem pushes each file in your repository to s3 whereas the
Capistrano_s3 gem compresses your repository and pushes to s3 as a single compressed file.

Git_2_S3 is a capistrano deployment strategy that will:

    * git clone locally
    * push the files to S3
    * each server pulls the files from S3 

This allows one to push a github repository to Amazon's S3 Data storage.

= Installation
  gem install git_2_s3

To use it, specify properties in <tt>config/deploy.rb</tt>:
  set :deploy_via, :s3_bucket
  set :deploy_s3_bucket, 'com.example.releases' # The name of the S3 bucket that should get releases
  s3_config = YAML::load(ERB.new(IO.read("secret/s3.yml")).result) # Follow this pattern and don't check in your secrets
  # s3_config = { 'AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER' => '1234-5678-9012', 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID' => 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST', 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' => 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567890ABC' }
  set :s3_config, s3_config

Now regular Capistrano deployment tasks will go to S3
